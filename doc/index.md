# ç‰›: Ox, a dependable predicatble Lisp

Ox is a Lisp dialect, which tries to learn from Scheme, Clojure and
Haskell.

Haskell and Clojure exemplify the degree to which programs can be
simplified when data is immutable, or at least when the amount of
mutable state is minimized and nonlocal effects are made difficult.

Scheme and Clojure demonstraight that is is possible to design and
implement powerful and useful languages which remain deeply simple in
terms both of implementation complexity and the simple number of
language contexts.

Unlike Clojure and Scheme however, Haskell, the ML family of languages
and its derivative demonstrate the extent which compiler assisted and
especially type directed case analysis can enable programmer
productivity.

The trick is getting all of this on one place.
