# ç‰› - Straw Proposal

This is/was the first sketch at Oxlang. This spec is not final and is
a sketch for debate only.

 - [The Parser](/straw/doc/parser.md)
 - [The Interfaces](/straw/doc/interfaces.md)
 - [Notes on the eventual stdlib](/straw/doc/stdlib.md)

The idea with this sketch was to simply provide a simple but still
imperative lambda calculus. This sketch is more a first attempt at a
clojure inspired Lisp that could become self hosting than a serious
proposal.
