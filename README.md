Oxlang is the child of my efforts on
[Oxcart](https://github.com/oxlang/oxcart), in that Oxlang is an
experiment aimed at building a simpler, static lisp. See
[my blog posts](http://arrdem.com/2014/09/10/ox:_a_preface/) for some
real motivational information.

## Usage

As of this writing, Oxlang is just a parser and a test suite. See
[the parser docs](/doc/parser.md) for some information and examples of
the parser in action. The
[evaluation notes on the parser](https://github.com/oxlang/oxlang/blob/master/doc/evaluation.md#reader)
explain why the parser/reader is the way it is now. If you want to
play with it, the parser is implemented in `ox.lang.parser`.

[See the docs](/doc/README.md) for my notes on what Oxlang is and
will be. [The issue tracker](https://github.com/oxlang/oxlang/issues)
is also being used to keep notes on what's up with Oxlang.
