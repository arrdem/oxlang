# ç‰›: Ox, the language

Ox is the child of my efforts on
[Oxcart](https://github.com/oxlang/oxcart), in that Ox is an
experiment aimed at building a simpler, static lisp. See
[my blog posts](http://arrdem.com/2014/09/10/ox:_a_preface/) for some
real motivational information.

Previously a monolithic project, in order to get more thoughts into
buffers in a structured fashion Ox is currently partitioned into
several proposals and sketches in the pattern of the Ada language
competition.

[Straw Man](/straw/) proposal - the first draft.

[Green](/green/) proposal - `env` as visible value, `module`.
