# ç‰›: Ox, the language

Ox is the child of my efforts on [Oxcart](https://github.com/oxlang/oxcart), in that Ox is an experiment aimed at building a simpler, static lisp.
See [my blog posts](http://arrdem.com/2014/09/10/ox:_a_preface/) for some real motivational information.

Previously a monolithic project, in order to get more thoughts into buffers in a structured fashion Ox is currently partitioned into several proposals and sketches in the pattern of the Ada language competition.

[Straw Man](/straw/) proposal - the first draft.

[Green](/green/) proposal - `env` as visible value, `module`.

## Community

As Oxlang is a work in progress as a language specification, there is no serious foundation as of yet for a user base.
However some provision has been made.
The developers can be found on Freenode's #oxlang channel.

There are also mailing lists:

- [Dev list](http://librelist.com/browser/dev.oxlang/)
- [User list](http://librelist.com/browser/general.oxlang/)

## Contributing

This project accepts PRs without requiring a contributors agreement or other paperwork.
As this project is very very young, those interested in its development are asked to contribute to this repository rather than forking off and developing their own variants.
Forks are inevitable in the long term and one of the goals of the Ox project is to allow for and enable them when the time comes, but first we need a working language!
