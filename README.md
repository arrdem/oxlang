# ç‰›: Ox, the language

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ox-lang/ox.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ox-lang/ox)

Ox is the child of my efforts on [Oxcart](https://github.com/oxlang/oxcart), in that Ox is an experiment aimed at building a simpler, static lisp in a spirit like that of Clojure.
See [my blog posts](http://arrdem.com/2014/09/10/ox:_a_preface/) for some real motivational information.

## Community

As Oxlang is a work in progress as a language specification, there is no serious foundation as of yet for a user base.
However some provision has been made.
The developers can be found on Freenode's #oxlang channel.

There are also mailing lists:

- [Dev list](http://librelist.com/browser/oxlang.dev/)
- [User list](http://librelist.com/browser/oxlang.general/)

## Contributing

This project accepts PRs without requiring a contributors agreement or other paperwork.
As this project is very very young, those interested in its development are asked to contribute to this repository rather than forking off and developing their own variants.
Forks are inevitable in the long term and one of the goals of the Ox project is to allow for and enable them when the time comes, but first we need a working language!
